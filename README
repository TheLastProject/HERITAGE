Heritage Equals Retro Interpreting Text Adventure Game Engine

What is HERITAGE?
=================

HERITAGE is a text adventure game engine, written in Javascript, capable of 
interpreting .heritage files.

.heritage files, also known as: HERITAGE Game Files, are files written in the 
HERITAGE file format. These files are fairly simple, yet powerful, markup 
files, written in a format specially tailored for the text adventure game 
genre. It is designed to be easy to use, yet powerful enough to make serious 
text adventure games in.

For an example, please look at example.heritage. Proper documentation to 
writing a text adventure game for HERITAGE will be written soon.
